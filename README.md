# KOLink Test Work

Experimental ETL workflows built during an internship to explore linking key opinion leaders (KOLs) across healthcare datasets. Includes ingestion, cleaning, and unification of primarily PubMed baseline data and the ClinicalTrials.gov API using Python and Pandas, with loading into PostgreSQL and Supabase to support a minimum viable product (MVP) dedicated to scoring and linking KOLs. This repository reflects exploratory, iterative work rather than a production-ready system.

> Note: The messiness of the workflows can be attributed to shifting designs during the internship.
